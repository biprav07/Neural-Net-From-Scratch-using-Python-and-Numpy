# Neural Network From Scratch ðŸ§ 

This project implements a basic feedforward neural network using only NumPy. It supports training on simple datasets and helps understand the fundamentals of forward and backward propagation.

## Features

- Custom layers (Dense/Fully connected)
- Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error
- Backpropagation with gradient descent
- No external ML libraries used

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
